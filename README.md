# Silly-Duko

## Welcome to <a href="https://peter-hennessy.github.io/silly-doku/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silly-Duko</a> A Board Game with a Twist

The idea for my project comes from a game I like to play myself, but I decided to add numbers and letters as a mix to excercise the brain more during game play.
During the game the user must decifer the correct number and letter to be placed in the correct box
Not at any point shall the same number be duplicated in the Same line or section. The player has a choice of three levels, three timers, which again can add to the challenge of the game. i have also given the choice of two themes.

# User Stories
- As a user I want to be able to be drawn into the page
- As a user I need to be able to see clearly where I want to go
- As a user I need to be able to see text and images clearly
- As a user i need to be able to understand the rules of the game


# Wireframes

# Game Structure
For the game I decide to create a board with boh numbers and letters. The board is made up of the traditional 81 squares

# Design Choices 

- ### Typography
For my project I decided to choose two fonts, Archivo as the text font and Roboto as the contrasting heading font with a default font of Sans-Serif. 
* 'Archivo' The Reason I chose this contrasting style is because the reading text is clear for the user to see. 
* 'Roboto' is used for the heading text which looks solid prominent and straight, which I feel adds a nice contrast when the user is reading the page

- ### Color Scheme
For this project I decided on a traditional color scheme of #0a0a0a which in a very _Dark Gray (mostly black)_ and #fff which is a _White_, and rgb(9,200,255) which is a shade of _Teal_  for the dark theme. 

To Check The Contrast between **Text** and **Background** I used [Color Contrast](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/112a46-acc8e5)

# Features
### Challenge Menu
This is situated in the upper bar of corner of the across all three pages to create continuity across the platform. Starting left to right this includes the following: 
- Choose level depending on the knowledge of the game the use has
- Choose a time to add to the callenge of the game, if the tme runs out before the game is complete then  **Game Over!!!**

- #### Home 
![SILLY-DUKO landing page](assets/css/images/readme-images)
This section has the landing Image with the Animated Circle cover text, this is created to draw the attention of the user to what the company does in a short brief text, but enough to draw curiosity of the user to look further

- 

- 

- #### Footer
On the Footer of the page the rules are outlined, the player must select the desired level, the desired time and the the **Let's Play** button. 


 # Future Features

 - In the future I would like to create a game where the numbers were pre selected using a specific algorithm, At the moment the game only has 3 boards with content, But it has 3 time levels which may add to the challenge
