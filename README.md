# Silly-Duko

## Welcome to <a href="https://peter-hennessy.github.io/silly-doku/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silly-Duko</a> A Board Game with a Twist

The idea for my project comes from a game I like to play myself, but I decided to add numbers and letters as a mix to excercise the brain more during game play.
During the game the user must decipher the correct number and letter to be placed in the correct box.
Not at any point shall the same number be duplicated in the Same line or section. The player has a choice of three levels, three timers, which again can add to the challenge of the game. I have also given the choice of two themes.

# User Stories
- As a user I want to be able to be drawn into the page
- As a user I need to be able to see clearly understand where I want to go
- As a user I need to be able to see text and images clearly
- As a user I need to be able to understand the rules of the game
- As A user I need to want to return to the game after the initial game is finished

# Wireframes

# Game Structure
* For the game I decided to create a board with both numbers and letters. The board is made up of the traditional 81 squares
* There is a timer to add to the challenge with a choice of 5 minutes, 10 minutes or 15 minutes
* Lives are displayed at the top of the board and each time an incorrect selection is made, a life is lost

# Design Choices 

- ### Typography
For my project I decided to choose two fonts, Archivo as the text font and Roboto as the contrasting heading font with a default font of Sans-Serif. 
* 'Archivo' The Reason I chose this contrasting style is because the reading text is clear for the user to see. 
* 'Roboto' is used for the heading text which looks solid prominent and straight, which I feel adds a nice contrast when the user is reading the page

- ### Color Scheme
For this project I decided on a traditional color scheme of #0a0a0a which in a very _Dark Gray (mostly black)_ and #fff which is a _White_, and rgb(9,200,255) which is a shade of _Teal_  for the dark theme. 

To Check The Contrast between **Text** and **Background**  on both the **light & Dark**I used [Color Contrast](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/112a46-acc8e5)

# Features
### Challenge Menu
This is situated in the upper section of the page Starting left to right this includes the following: 
- Choose level depending on the knowledge of the game the use has
- Once the player selects the desired level and time they then hit the **Let's Play** button which will start the game
- Choose a time to add to the challenge of the game, if the time runs out before the game is complete then  **Game Over!!!**

- #### Home 
![SILLY-DUKO landing page](assets/readme-images/screen-1.png) ![SILLY-DUKO open landing page](assets/readme-images/screen-2.png)
- In Image 1 the user is greeted by a screen with level, time, and theme options. The rules are at the bottom of the page. Once the user selected the desired option, reads the rules , then they press the **Let’s Play** button.
- In Image 2 the game appears with the clock counting down, and the lives clearly displayed

- #### Footer
On the Footer of the page the rules are outlined to explain to the player how the game works

 # Future Features

 - In the future I would like to create a game where the numbers were pre selected using a specific algorithm, At the moment the game only has 3 boards with content, But it has 3 time levels which may add to the challenge
